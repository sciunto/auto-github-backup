auto-github-backup
==================

Script to automate github-backup: https://github.com/joeyh/github-backup


Dependencies
============

* python3
* github-backup

Why?
====

I use this script to fetch a copy of my repositories and also repositories which contain codes I appreciate.
There is two ways to specify the repo:
* its organisation (like sciunto)
* its repo (like sciunto/auto-github-backup)

The script is just a wrapper on github-backup.
